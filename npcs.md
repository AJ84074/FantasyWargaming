## Gealach Foil - Patron of the Whistful Jackals

Gealach Foil (GYAL-akh fwill) is striking in appearance with her long thick strait platinum blonde hair, lily white skin, rose red lips, petite nose, pearl white teeth, high cheek bones, and vibrant bright golden eyes that glow faintly in complete darkness and fiercely bright when she experiences intense emotions.

Her clothing is of a strange style (Atlantean) and she wears a body hugging silk suit covered by a large billowing loose fitting silk covering over her entire body, plus long silk lace gloves, silk lace stockings, and a silk headdress with a veil. Her shoes are silk sandals or calf high silk boots. The color of all her clothing is a light cream color.
She usually wears her hair in a long black silk bag to make it appear, under her other silks, that her hair is black.  
None of her skin is directly visible under her veil, gloves, and stockings and the cream color of her silk and lace give the impression that her skin is light tan in color.
She makes all of her own clothing and raises her own silk worms.
Her primary income is from the silk of her silk worm farms, whose production is increased using her Atlantean magic.

She wears multiple gold necklaces, bracelets, and anklets all decorated with ornate hanging gold leaves that jingle faintly when moves. 
Her rings and bracelets are all ornately crafted gold covered in strange writings and symbols (Atlantean).
She wears no jewels or gemstones.

Her voice is soothing and gentle and those with great hearing will notice it sounds like her voice has a slight echo as if two nearly identical voices speaking at the same time.

She speaks and reads all languages because Atlantean is the root of all other languages, but she is unable to teach anyone else her own language as only an Atlantean can learn it.

Gaelach Foil was spared the destruction of her people because at the time she was imprisoned far away in a magical tomb.

She is currently attempting to bring about a new idea to the world: a kingdom. All of her work and effort is to bring about the creation of a kingdom of city states under the rule of one leader so that she can unite humanity can against the tyranny of the annunaki/igigi. 

She is the only, and last, of her kind.

### Atlantean

Atlanteans are a now virtually extinct race of humans.
It is said that they reached to far and too fast with their magic and technology and their civilization paid the ultimate price for their arrogance.
In truth the annunaki/igigi feared the magic of the Atlanteans and destroyed their civiliation, lest they learn the truth and rise up against their tyrants.

The Atlanteans practiced two forms of now lost magic: ballomancy and sonomancy.
Through dance, songs, chants, and hums the Atlantean's changed the face of the world and the course of history.
Although their magic is complex and takes at least several minutes to complete even the simplest of spells, the power and duration of their magic is unequalled.

## The Whistful Jackals

The Whistful Jackals are a mercenary company made up primarily of were-jackals.
They have never included anyone that they didn't intend on "adopting" into the family until they suddenly had access a sorceress, priest, and scholar.
They know that they cannot turn the sorceress, even if they could turn her friends.
They also do not wish to condem others to their fate unless there are precious few other options.
