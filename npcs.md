## Gealach Foil - Patron of the Whistful Jackals

Gealach Foil (GYAL-akh fwill) is striking in appearance with her long thick strait platinum blonde hair, lily white skin, rose red lips, petite nose, pearl white teeth, high cheek bones, and vibrant bright golden eyes that glow faintly in complete darkness and fiercely bright when she experiences intense emotions.

Her clothing is of a strange style (Atlantean) and she wears a body hugging silk suit covered by a large billowing loose fitting silk covering over her entire body, plus long silk lace gloves, silk lace stockings, and a silk headdress with a veil. Her shoes are silk sandals or calf high silk boots. The color of all her clothing is a light cream color.
She usually wears her hair in a long black silk bag to make it appear, under her other silks, that her hair is black.  
None of her skin is directly visible under her veil, gloves, and stockings and the cream color of her silk and lace give the impression that her skin is light tan in color.
She makes all of her own clothing and raises her own silk worms.
Her primary income is from the silk of her silk worm farms, whose production is increased using her Atlantean magic.

She wears multiple gold necklaces, bracelets, and anklets all decorated with ornate hanging gold leaves that jingle faintly when moves. 
Her rings and bracelets are all ornately crafted gold covered in strange writings and symbols (Atlantean).
She wears no jewels or gemstones.

Her voice is soothing and gentle and those with great hearing will notice it sounds like her voice has a slight echo as if two nearly identical voices speaking at the same time.

She speaks and reads all languages because Atlantean is the root of all other languages, but she is unable to teach anyone else her own language as only an Atlantean can learn it.

Gaelach Foil was spared the destruction of her people because at the time she was imprisoned far away in a magical tomb.

She is currently attempting to bring about a new idea to the world: a kingdom. All of her work and effort is to bring about the creation of a kingdom of city states under the rule of one leader so that she can unite humanity can against the tyranny of the annunaki/igigi. 

She is the only, and last, of her kind.

### Atlantean

Atlanteans are a now virtually extinct race of humans.
It is said that they reached to far and too fast with their magic and technology and their civilization paid the ultimate price for their arrogance.
In truth the annunaki/igigi feared the magic of the Atlanteans and destroyed their civiliation, lest they learn the truth and rise up against their tyrants.

The Atlanteans practiced three forms of now lost magic: appellomancy, ballomancy, and sonomancy.
Through dance, songs, chants, hums, and mere spoken words the Atlantean's changed the face of the world and the course of history.
Although their magic is complex and takes at least several minutes to complete even the simplest of spells, the power and duration of their magic is unequalled.

## The Whistful Jackals

The Whistful Jackals are a mercenary company made up primarily of werelions.
They normally never included magical or religious members as they can use magic to identify them as werelions and usualy become hostile toward them.

### Werelions

Werelions are created when someone is looked in the eye by the great sphinx Ankhetperure.

The Whistful Jackals are a mercenary group who once travelled to the great delta of northern Khemti in search of fame and fortune.
They were tricked into attempting to steal treasure from the great sphinx Ankhetperure.
The sphinx immediately knew that it was their employers intent to steal from her so she looked each member of the Whistful Jackals directly in the eye and then commanded them to return to their employer with the treasure.
Once in their employer's presence, they immediately transformed into werelions and ate him and his entire household.
Horrified by what they had done they sought out the sphinx in hopes of removing the curse.

When they eventually found the Ankhetperure again, she told them that this was to be their punishment for a thousand years and that whosoever they love that discovers their secret will be slain and eaten by them with their own fangs and claws.

Some great time later, after years of loneliness, Thistle met an Akkadian man named Rhul Utek.
She tried to ignore her budding feelings and tried to take it very slowly, but soon fell deeply in love.
The rest of the band, cautious but also lonely themselves, welcomed him into their company and their lives.
They were married after a brief courtship and they spent the next year together happily travelling from battle to battle.
One night when on night patrol Rhul Utek happened upon pride of lions killing enemy soldiers in the dead of night.
He followed them expertly, using mud to mask his scent, hoping to find one alone so he could kill it as a trophy for Thistle.
As he followed them they moved away from the battle for some distance before painfully transforming into terrifying beasts and then finally into naked men and women.
His horror turned to heartbreak as he quickly realized these monsters were members of his mercenary family and his beloved wife was among them.
He quickly and quitely returned to his partol and eventually to his mercenary company the following morning.

He remained quiet throughout the day and made every effort to hide the fact that he knew his mercenary family and wife were monsters.
That evening in their tent Thistle was particularly aroused and affectionate, refusing to take accept his rebuttals.
Eventually he relented and they shared the most intensely passionate lovemaking session he had ever experienced.
He was completely exhausted by their lovemaking and resolved to tell her in the morning that he knew her secret, that it didn't matter, and that he would continue to love her and stay with her and help her find a cure if that were even possible.
He slept more soundly and deeply than he had ever slept before.

During the night Thistle transformed and killed and ate his lungs, stomach, liver, and intestines.
When she woke up covered in blood she ran out of her tent naked, panicked, and sobbing.

It was some great time later before anyone in the company ever attempted a relationship again, and those relationships would remain mere trists and paid encounters.
