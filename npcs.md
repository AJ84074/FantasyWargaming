## Gealach Foil

Gealach Foil (GYAL-akh fwill) is striking in appearance with her long thick strait platinum blonde hair, lily white skin, rose red lips, petite nose, pearl white teeth, high cheek bones, and vibrant bright golden eyes that glow faintly in complete darkness and fiercely bright when she experiences intense emotions.

Her clothing is of a strange style (Atlantean) and she wears a body hugging silk suit covered by a large billowing loose fitting silk covering over her entire body, plus long silk lace gloves, silk lace stockings, and a silk headdress with a veil. Her shoes are silk sandals or calf high silk boots. The color of all her clothing is a light cream color.
None of her skin is directly visible under her veil, gloves, and stockings and the cream color of her silk and lace give the impression that her skin is light tan in color.

She wears multiple gold necklaces, bracelets, and anklets all decorated with ornate hanging gold leaves that jingle faintly when moves. 
Her rings and bracelets are all ornately crafted gold covered in strange writings and symbols (Atlantean).
She wears no jewels or gemstones.

Her voice is airy, silky, sweet, soothing, and rich in tone and those with great hearing will notice it sounds like her voice has a slight echo as if two nearly identical voices speaking at the same time.

She speaks and reads all languages because Atlantean is the root of all other languages, but she is unable to teach anyone else her own language as only an Atlantean can learn it.

Gaelach Foil was spared the destruction of her people because at the time she was imprisoned far away in a magical tomb.

She is currently attempting to bring about a new idea to the world: a kingdom. All of her work and effort is to bring about the creation of a kingdom of city states under the rule of one leader so that she can unite humanity can against the tyranny of the annunaki/igigi. 

She is the only, and last, of her kind.
