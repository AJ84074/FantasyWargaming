## Festivals
Ancient Mesopotamians had ceremonies each month. The theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:
* The Lunar phase (a waxing moon meant abundance and growth, while a waning moon was associated with decline, conservation, and festivals of the Underworld)
* The phase of the annual agricultural cycle
* Equinoxes and solstices
* The local mythos and its divine Patrons
* The success of the reigning Monarch
* The Akitu, or New Year Festival (First full moon after spring equinox)
* Commemoration of specific historical events (founding, military victories, temple holidays, etc.)
