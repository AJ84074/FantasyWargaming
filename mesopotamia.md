Eventually Sumer was unified by Eannatum, but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later. The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings. The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations.

## Festivals
Ancient Mesopotamians had ceremonies each month. The theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:
* The Lunar phase (a waxing moon meant abundance and growth, while a waning moon was associated with decline, conservation, and festivals of the Underworld)
* The phase of the annual agricultural cycle
* Equinoxes and solstices
* The local mythos and its divine Patrons
* The success of the reigning Monarch
* The Akitu, or New Year Festival (First full moon after spring equinox)
* Commemoration of specific historical events (founding, military victories, temple holidays, etc.)
